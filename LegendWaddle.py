# The purpose of this program is to explicate the usage of calculial (a type of math used to redefine superposition and rename it as quantumposition, along with tangentially corrected superbits. Superbits are qubits that rely on domain-specific definitions of the partial derivatives of the derivative of the space-time and time-space functional equations.)

## dP/dt = 2*y

e = -1;

## Given the above definition of e, e**4 would be equal to 1, since (-1)**4 = 1.

y = 0.5; 
multidimensional_time = 0.5
population_partial_derivative_with_respect_to_time = 2 * y;
tangential_y_function_with_respect_to_time = multidimensional_time *math.log((e**multidimensional_time));
### The integral of dt/dy is 2 seconds displaced
tangentail_time_with_respect_to_location = 2

#### Please note that this program is to serve as a proof and not code to be executed. It proves given the above, if our definition of superpositon were defined as x**2 + y**3 + z**4 + n*N*(hcrossbar)*D, then the previous expression would yield all superpositions. With that information calculating safe, and or healthy, superpositions would be possible, relatively easy, meaningful, and manageable.
